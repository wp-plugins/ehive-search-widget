A widget plugin that provides access to eHive Search from a widget.

== Description ==

This plugin is part of a suite of plugins created by Vernon Systems Ltd., which give you the power to embed eHive functionality into your WordPress website.

This widget plugin provides a simple search form that can be embedded into any widget area on your site. It works with the eHive Search plugin to give your site the potential for eHive search capability on every page.

Because this is a widget plugin it can be added to sidebars, footers or any other page section that allows widgets. This also means the widget's functionality can be made available on every page of your site.

Before you install this plugin you will need to install the eHive Access and eHive Object Search plugins. While eHive search will function and return results without the eHive Object Details plugin, it is likely that you will want to install the eHive Object Details plugin so your users can click through and view the Object Record in detail.

Q. What do these plugins do?

A. The eHive plugin suite gives you the ability to provide eHive functionality to your site's visitors. This means that you can search and display eHive records, leave comments that are visible also in ehive and add and remove tags to records where the record owner has given permission to do so. You can filter the search results by account or community if you want to display only records from a particular source. We also provide plugins to do other nice things like display grids of interesting, popular or recent images added to eHive; display galleries of other objects by the same account as a record you are viewing etc.
